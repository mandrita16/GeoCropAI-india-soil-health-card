Since the soil health cards contain information about the geolocation of the farms, as a sanity check we have made sure that the geolocation provided is within India atleast. Hence, the geolocation data is extracted from the cards only if the point is within India.   

The India shape file data is taken from the [datameets website](https://github.com/datameet/maps/blob/master/Country/india-composite.geojson).
